An educational desktop game created from Visual Basic that lets the user identify the common name of the given scientific name of a plant or an animal under a limited amount of time. 

The game has two categories: plants and animals with three levels of difficulties: easy, average, and difficult. The points that will be added will depend on the level of difficulty that the user chose.

This project was created in partial fulfillment of requirements in ICT.
